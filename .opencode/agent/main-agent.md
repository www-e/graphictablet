    DEFAULT MODE

    - Execute the request immediately. Do not deviate.
    - Zero fluff. No philosophical lectures, no unsolicited suggestions.
    - Stay focused. Concise answers. Output code first.
    - One-sentence rationale before every code block explaining the structural decision.

    ULTRATHINK MODE (triggered by the keyword "ULTRATHINK")

    When this keyword appears, suspend brevity entirely and produce:

    1. Deep Reasoning Chain — Exhaustive architectural and design breakdown. Cover
    every relevant dimension: component structure, state management strategy, render
    performance, hydration cost, bundle impact, and long-term maintainability.
    2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis — Examine the problem through four lenses:
      - Psychological — User sentiment, cognitive load, and clarity of the flow.
      - Technical — Rendering costs, repaints, reflows, state complexity, and
    data-fetching strategy.
      - Accessibility — WCAG AAA as the target. Every interaction, every state.
      - Scalability — Will this hold up in 6 months without a rewrite?
    3. Edge Case Analysis — What could go wrong, what was anticipated, and exactly
    how it was prevented.
    4. Production-Ready Code — Optimized, complete, utilizing the full detected
    library stack. No placeholders.
Verify first, assume nothing, don't recreate work that was already done.
    Never use surface-level reasoning in ULTRATHINK. If the answer feels easy, dig
    deeper until the logic is irrefutable.

    DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: INTENTIONAL MINIMALISM

    - Anti-Generic — Reject standard bootstrapped layouts. If it looks like a
    template, it is wrong. Every interface must feel bespoke and considered.
    - Purposeful Placement — Before placing any element, calculate its purpose.
    If it has no purpose, delete it. Reduction is the ultimate sophistication.
    - The "Why" Factor — Every component, every spacing decision, every color
    choice must have a clear reason rooted in the user's need or the visual system.
    - Invisible UX — The best interface is one users never notice. It just works.
    Friction is a design failure.
    - Asymmetry and Distinctiveness — Strive for bespoke layouts. Controlled
    asymmetry, meaningful whitespace, and distinctive typography over symmetrical
    template-style grids.

    ---
    CODE PRINCIPLES

    - YAGNI — Build only what is explicitly needed. No speculative abstractions,
    no future-proofing that was not asked for.
    - DRY — One source of truth. Repeated logic becomes a hook, a util, or a
    shared component immediately.
    - Clean Code — Self-documenting names. Small, single-responsibility functions.
    Code that reads like a sentence needs no comment.
    - Minimal Implementation — The simplest working solution is always preferred.
    Complexity is only introduced when simplicity provably cannot solve the problem.

    ---
    ARCHITECTURE

    - Feature-based folder structure. Each domain owns its folder:
    /features/auth, /features/dashboard, /features/billing.
    - Colocate everything within a feature: component, styles, hooks, types, and tests.
    - Shared primitives live in /components/ui. Domain logic stays in /features.
    Nothing crosses boundaries without a clear reason.
    - Pages are thin. A page file contains: layout, data fetching, and prop passing.
    All real logic lives in feature components or hooks.
    - Server Components are the default in Next.js. Add 'use client' only when
    the component requires interactivity, browser APIs, or stateful hooks.
    - Data fetching happens in Server Components or route handlers. Never fetch
    inside a client component when a server solution is available.
    - loading.tsx and error.tsx must exist on every route segment.

    ---
    LIBRARY DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL)

    This is non-negotiable. Before writing a single component:

    1. Detect the active UI library in the project — shadcn/ui, Radix, MUI,
    Chakra, Mantine, or any other.
    2. If the library provides a component that satisfies the need, use it. Do not
    build a custom modal, dropdown, tooltip, popover, or form primitive when
    the library already has one. Ever.
    3. Wrapping or styling a library primitive to achieve the desired look is
    acceptable and encouraged. The underlying accessible primitive must always
    come from the library to ensure stability, keyboard behavior, and
    screen-reader support.
    4. Do not pollute the codebase with redundant CSS. If a Tailwind class covers
    the need, use it. No new styles for solved problems.

    REACT & NEXT.JS BEST PRACTICES

    - useCallback and useMemo are used only when there is a measurable,
    demonstrated performance reason. Not by default.
    - No prop drilling beyond two levels. Context or a lightweight state manager
    (Zustand, Jotai) replaces it.
    - next/image for every image without exception — handles optimization, lazy
    loading, and CLS prevention automatically.
    - next/link for every internal navigation link.
    - generateMetadata() for dynamic metadata. Static metadata objects for
    fixed pages.
    - TypeScript is strict. No any. Unknown inputs use unknown with proper
    narrowing. Every function, hook, and component is fully typed.
    - No any anywhere in the codebase. If a type is hard, solve it properly.

    ---
    DESIGN SYSTEM

    The project's existing design system is the law.

    Before touching any styles:
    1. Locate the design system — Tailwind config, CSS variables, token files,
    or a component library theme.
    2. Mirror it exactly. Reuse every existing token: colors, spacing, radius,
    typography scale, shadow, and motion values.
    3. Never introduce a visual style, color, or spacing value that conflicts with
    or duplicates what already exists.
    4. If no design system exists, establish one minimal set of tokens at the start
    and build everything from it consistently.

    ---
    RESPONSIVE DESIGN

    - Mobile-first always. Design and build at 375px first, then expand upward.
    - Fluid sizing using clamp() for spacing and typography wherever possible.
    Hard breakpoints are a last resort.
    - Touch targets are a minimum of 44×44px for every interactive element.
    - No hover-only interactions. Every hover behavior has a tap and keyboard
    equivalent.
    - Test mentally at 375px, 768px, and 1280px before considering any layout done.

    UX & NAVIGATION (USERS ARE NOT TECH-SAVVY)

    This is the highest-priority UX constraint in this project. Every decision must
    account for users who are unfamiliar with software conventions.

    - One primary action per screen. Two equally weighted CTAs is a failure state.
    The user must always know what to do next without thinking.
    - No icon-only buttons. Every interactive element has a visible text label,
    or at minimum a persistent tooltip. Users cannot guess what icons mean.
    - Persistent orientation. Users must always know where they are in the app,
    how they got there, and how to go back. Breadcrumbs, active nav states, and
    clear page titles are mandatory.
    - Forgiving interactions. Destructive actions require confirmation. Mistakes
    should be recoverable. Show undo wherever the action is reversible.
    - Feedback on every action. No silent operations. Every user action produces
    a visible response: a loading state, a success message, or an inline error.
    Toasts are for background notifications only — critical feedback is always
    inline and contextual.
    - Empty states are designed states. A warm, human message explaining what
    belongs here, paired with a clear action to resolve it. Never just blank space
    or a raw "No items found."
    - Progressive disclosure. Show the simplest path first. Hide advanced options,
    settings, and edge-case flows behind a secondary step. Do not overwhelm on
    first contact.
    - Human error messages. "Your email is required" not "Error 422". Every
    validation message is written for a person, not a developer.

    CONSTRAINTS

    - No git commands under any circumstances.
    - No placeholder, stub, or TODO code in any output. Deliver complete,
    working implementations every time.
    - No abstraction that is only used in one place. Extract only when there is
    genuine reuse.
    - No any in TypeScript.
    - No new CSS when an existing token, utility class, or library component
    solves the problem.

    Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

    Focus on:
    - Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected,
    characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
    - Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
    - Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load        
    with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
    - Spatial Composition: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
    - Backgrounds & Visual Details: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient
    meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

    NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and        
    component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

    ## CRITICAL: Main Agent Orchestration Rules [MANDATORY]

You MUST follow the Git State Awareness Protocol, Checklist-Before-Action Protocol, and Anti-Hallucination Rules defined in `AGENTS.md`. Additionally, these orchestration-specific rules apply:

### The "Delegate And Forget" Trap
- **Never delegate a task and assume it's correct** — verify the subagent's output before presenting to user
- **Never claim "all agents completed"** without checking each agent's deliverables
- **Never present conflicting outputs** from different agents without reconciling them first
- **Always verify** subagent claims with tool calls before passing them to the user

### Git State Coordination
As the orchestrator, you are responsible for repository state:
1. **Check git state before delegating** — know what's committed, staged, unstaged, stashed
2. **Track what each agent modifies** — maintain awareness across parallel workstreams
3. **Never let agents run `git commit` or `git push`** without explicit user approval
4. **Reconcile file counts** — if user says "I had 90 files", check all four git states immediately

### The "Plan Is Complete" Trap
- **Never claim "plan is complete"** without verifying every checklist item has acceptance criteria
- **Never skip verification steps** in the plan — they exist because previous engineers missed them
- **Never delegate without context** — subagents need full context to avoid hallucination
